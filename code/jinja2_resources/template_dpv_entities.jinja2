    <h2>Introduction</h2>

  </figure>
  <p>[=Entity=] in DPV refer to the concept of 'entity' as defined in law and society, which can be organisations or individuals, and which is distinct from the technical concept of 'agent'. A [=LegalEntity=] specifically refers to entities recognised legally or within legal norms. Expanding on these, DPV provides a taxonomy of entities based on their application within laws and use-cases in the form of <a href="#vocab-entities-legalrole"><i>Legal roles</i></a>, such as [=DataController=], [=DataSubject=], and [=Authority=]. Later, these concepts are expanded into taxonomies for different kinds of entities categorised under a common concept. For example, <a href="#vocab-entities-datasubject">categories of <i>Data Subjects</i></a> such as [=Adult=], [=User=], or [=Employee=]; or <a href="#vocab-entities-authorities">kinds of <i>Authorities</i></a>, or <a href="#vocab-entities-organisation">categories of <i>Organisations</i></a>.</p>
  <p>The relation [=hasEntity=] is used to refer to an entity or associate it with a context, for example to indicate its involvement. More specific relations are provided to indicate legal roles, such as [=hasDataSubject=], [=hasDataController=], [=hasDataProcessor=], and so on.</p>

  <section id="vocab-entities-legalrole">
    <h2>Legal Roles</h2>
    <p><i>Legal Role</i> is the role taken on by a legal entity based on definitions or criterias from laws, regulations, or other such normative sources. Legal roles assist in representing the role and responsibility of an entity within the context of processing, and from this to determine the requirements and obligations that should apply, and their compliance or conformance.</p>
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['entities-legalrole']['schemes']['classes']) }}
    <section id="desc-data-controller">
        <h3>Data Controller</h3>
        <p>A [=DataController=] is the entity responsible for the determination of processing of personal data. The exact meaning of 'responsible' and 'determination' varies across jurisdictions and laws. For example, [[GDPR]] defines a controller as the entity that determines 'means' and 'purposes' of processing personal data i.e. the entity that not only determine which data is being processed, but also the why and how of it. DPV does not prescribe to any particular jurisdictional definition, and the term 'Controller' here is analogous to the ISO term 'PII Controller'.</p>
        <p>To indicate the name, address, and contact details for a controller, the properties `hasName`, `hasAddress`, and `hasContact` are provided. Other properties can also be used to provide this as well as additional details, such as [[[FOAF]]] or <a href="https://schema.org/Organization">Schema.org</a>.</p>
        <p>To indicate an entity acting as the representative of the controller, the concept [=Representative=] and relation [=hasRepresentative=] are provided. Representatives can be present to maintain presence in multiple jurisdictions without the controller having to open new units in those divisions. The location or jurisdiction of representatives can be expressed by using the DPV concepts e.g. [=hasLocation=] and [=hasJurisdiction=].</p>

    <section id="desc-data-processor">
        <h3>Data Processor</h3>
        <p>A Data Processor is an entity which processes personal data on behalf of the controller i.e. the controller provides instructions to the processor for what processing activities to perform. The processor is only responsible for carrying out the processing as stipulated by the controller. The term 'Processor' is analogous to the ISO term 'PII Processor'. Name, address, and contact details of a processor can be specified using the same properties as that of a controller. Similarly, representatives of a processor can also be indicated by using the [=Representative=] and [=hasRepresentative=] concepts.</p>
        <p>The instructions from a Controller to a Processor typically take the form of a [=ControllerProcessorAgreement=] which is a contract between the two entities. The contract can specify which entity takes on which role, what activities are to be performed by whom, and any other pertinent details regarding processing of personal data.</p>

    <h2>Authorities</h2>
    <p>The concept [=Authority=] is a specific Governmental Organisation authorised to enforce a law or regulation. Authorities can be associated with a specific domain, topic, or jurisdiction. DPV currently defines regional authorities for [=NationalAuthority=], [=RegionalAuthority=], and [=SupraNationalAuthority=], and [=DataProtectionAuthority=] represents authorities associated with data protection and privacy. To associate authorities with concepts, the relations [=hasAuthority=] and [=isAuthorityFor=] are provided.</p>

Some examples of such types are agency-based roles: [=Adult=] and [=Child=], [=ParentOfDataSubject=], [=GuardianOfDataSubject=]; those associated with vulnerability: [=VulnerableDataSubject=], [=ElderlyDataSubject=], [=AsylumSeeker=]; domain-specific roles such as [=Patient=], [=Employee=], [=Student=], jurisdictional roles such as [=Citizen=], [=NonCitizen=], [=Immigrant=]; and general roles such as [=User=], [=Member=], [=Participant=], and [=Client=].</p>
